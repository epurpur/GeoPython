# GeoPython Workshop

Today we will be learning about the combination of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and python. We will be covering a lot
of topics today. This course is intended to focus on concepts. All the code is provided both in a python file and a Jupyter 
Notebook for you to learn and experiment with on your own.

## Python
[Python Homepage](https://www.python.org/)

If you are not familiar with python, it is a free and open source programming language that has become very popular in recent 
years. [From the python.org webpage](https://www.python.org/about/): Python is powerful, fast, plays well with others, runs
everywhere, is friendly & easy to learn, and is open. [From Wikipedia]
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language): "Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance."
